# RestAPI_HandleUsing_PostMan
Contact Management System REST API

This is a simple Contact Management System implemented as a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) contact information. The application handles basic contact information including name, email, and phone number.

Features

Add a new contact: Submit contact information (name, email, phone) via a POST request.

View all contacts: Retrieve a list of all contacts via a GET request.

View a single contact by ID: Retrieve a specific contact's details by passing the contact's ID.

Update contact details: Modify the contact information (name, email, phone) by providing the ID of the contact.

Delete a contact: Remove a contact from the list by specifying the contact's ID.

Here I am Testing the API using Postman

Postman: Send HTTP requests to the endpoints (e.g., POST /contacts, GET /contacts, etc.).
